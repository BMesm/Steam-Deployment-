## Description

The aim of this project is to be able to properly deploy scrapped data from the website Steam.
The data set was provided in a Json format. Because of this was required to converted in a cleaned way, to SQL. To do this purpose first it was needed to convert it into a pandas dataframe, and unravel all the nested dictionaries inside of the columns. Then, with the help of sqlalchemy we populated a table to format SQL. Futhermore we built relashions between the main table and an adjacent one, namely price.
With this we could deploy locally, with flaskmigrate, two plots related to this data set, as well as the table itself.
It was used some HTML code to make the website more user friendly and appealing.
We also scrapped more then 4000 url's from each game in order to add more information about them. In a second fase, we were able to futher gather information over 2000.
Finally in order to bring our work to the world we exposed it with Heroku, with the following web link: steam4u.herokuapp.com .


## Installation
* Python 3.8
* Jupyter notebook
* Trello
* Docker
* Heroku

## Databases 
The data was scrapped from the Steam website. It can be founded on it's raw format on the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/becodeorg/GNT-Arai-2.31/master/content/additional_resources/datasets/steam%20scrape/database.json?token=AUDYUGADWYEEUMWSRLY7VOLBHB5CI .

Regarding the SQL format, the data can be found on this link: http://steam4u.herokuapp.com/view .


## Packages used
* Pandas
* Sqlite
* Flaskmigrate
* Sqlalchemy
* Plotly
* Matplotlib
* json

## Problems encountered
Our main goal initially was to have only one SQL table with all the information. As the project progressed, we realized that including relational tabels would be a great add on. Because of doing it in a later process of our project, we could only inclued an extra tabel, being 'Price'. We were going to inclued pc requirements, but this had to be left out because of some improper funtion building with regex.



## Final words

Deploying is an important step in being able to expose one's work to the world.
In this situation, this project brought better insight over dealing with SQL, manipulating Json files, deploying locally thought python libraries, and understanding Docker and Heroku. Html was also important to get some basic concepts.
