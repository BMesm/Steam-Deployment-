# Project Deployment

## Description

The aim of this project is to be able to properly deploy a previously scrapped data set from the website Steam.
The data set was provided in a Json format. Because of this was required to converted in a cleaned way, to SQL. To do this purpose first it was needed to convert into a pandas dataframe, and unravel all the nested dictionaries inside of the columns. Then, with the help of sqlalchemy we populated a table to format SQL. With this we could deploy locally with flaskmigrate plots related to this data set, as well as the table itself.
Finally we created q Dockerfile to be able to deploy our work as a container.
In order to bring our work to the world we finally exposed it with Heroku, with the following web link: steam4u.herokuapp.com .


## Installation
* Python 3.8
* Jupyter notebook
* Trello
* Docker
* Heroku

## Databases 
This data was extracted from the Steam website. It can be founded on this link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/becodeorg/GNT-Arai-2.31/master/content/additional_resources/datasets/steam%20scrape/database.json?token=AUDYUGADWYEEUMWSRLY7VOLBHB5CI.


## Packages used
* Pandas
* Sqlite
* Flaskmigrate
* Sqlalchemy
* Plotly
* Matplotlib
* json

## Final words


Deploying it is an important step in being able to expose one's work to the world.
In this situation, this project brought better insight over dealing with SQL, manipulating Json files, deploying locally thought python libraries, and understanding Docker and Heroku. Html was also important to get some basic concepts.
